 Blog App ================ Blog App is a mobile application built using Flutter that allows users to write and manage blog posts. This project is designed with clean architecture principles, adhering to SOLID principles of object-oriented programming, and utilizing dependency injection for a more scalable and maintainable codebase. Additionally, it incorporates Hive for local storage, Supabase for authentication and online storage, and Bloc for state management. Overview Blog App is a comprehensive mobile application designed to facilitate the creation, editing, and management of blog posts. It is built using Flutter, a popular and powerful framework for building mobile applications. The app is structured around a clean architecture, which separates the application into three main layers: data, domain, and presentation. This approach ensures that each layer is responsible for a specific task, making it easier to maintain and update the application. Features User Authentication: The app uses Supabase for user authentication, allowing users to register and log in securely. Blog Post Management: Users can create, edit, and delete blog posts, with features for adding and editing content, images, and tags. Local Storage: Hive is used for local storage, ensuring that user data is stored securely on the device. Online Storage: Supabase is used for online storage, allowing users to access their blog posts from any device. State Management: Bloc is used for state management, ensuring that the app's UI is always in sync with the app's state. Architecture Data Layer The data layer is responsible for handling data storage and retrieval. It uses Hive for local storage and Supabase for online storage. Domain Layer The domain layer defines the business logic of the app, including the rules and constraints for managing blog posts. Presentation Layer The presentation layer is responsible for rendering the app's UI. It uses Flutter widgets to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. Technical Requirements Flutter: The app is built using Flutter, a popular and powerful framework for building mobile applications. Hive: Hive is used for local storage, ensuring that user data is stored securely on the device. Supabase: Supabase is used for user authentication and online storage, allowing users to access their blog posts from any device. Bloc: Bloc is used for state management, ensuring that the app's UI is always in sync with the app's state.
